# Installation Guide

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After that, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the program by executing the  following command:

```bash
python script.py
```

> Replace `script.py` with the name of the script you want to run.

You may have to change directory to the location of the script before running the command.
